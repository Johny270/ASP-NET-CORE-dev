# OVERVIEW
This second ASP.NET CORE application was really nothing special. Except a demo
to help have a feel of what ASP.NET Core dev looked like. it was a great reminder
of working using the MVC architecture. In fact, the project was built using the mvc
template using the shell:
```
    dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 6.0.100 --output PartyInvites
    dotnet new mvc --no-https --output PartyInvites --framework net6.0
    dotnet new sln -o PartyInvites
    dotnet sln PartyInvites add PartyInvites
```
